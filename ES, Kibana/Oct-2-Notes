Refer apache-beats.conf under Logstash folder:-
index => "apache-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}" ------> In Kibana, create this index pattern (apache-*) to pull apache logs from ES. Likewise, you can create several index patterns in Kibana to match the index name in ES & pull those logs.

Refer ss-1:-
There are 100 fields (ex: hostname, tags (which are given in filebeat.yml), host.os., response.keyword etc,.) available in the apache-* index pattern. You can search logs in that index by referencing any of those 100 fields.

Refer ss-2:-
There are 20 hits => In /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml (filebeat config file), we have set the path (path to look for logs) as "/var/log/apache2/access.log" & this path has captured 20 logs => these are parsed along to Kibana which we are seeing as 20 hits. 
This path above is the path inside the web server(s) where filebeat is also installed.

Note:-
1) ES has indexes.
2) Each index stores logs as JSON docs. Thats why in Kibana, you'll see every log in JSON format. 


Trainer has run runapache.sh (test script) & has got about 178 hits:-
1) In Kibana you can see 178 hits, out of which 95 are 200 OK code & 83 are 404 error code. 
2) 200 OK logs are captured from "/var/log/apache2/access.log" & 404 error logs are captured from "/var/log/apache2/error.log". 
These 2 paths should be mentioned in path (path to look for logs) field inside filebeat.yml.
3) Refer ss-3:- 
To filter 404 logs in Kibana, type response.keyword : 404 in search bar to fetch the 110 404 error logs. This is KQL.


Go to Dashboard > click on "Create Visualization":-

1) Refer ss-4: click on response.keyword field on the left & it will display a "bar vertical stacked" chart by default. refer ss-5
2) You can change the default setting to "pie" chart as shown in ss-6
3) after selecting pie chart, your visualization will change to something like in ss-7. This is more clear with % of 200 logs & 404 logs
4) Refer ss-8: you can name this visualization (HttpResponses) using the Save button on top right corner. You can also press the button "Refresh" to refresh the no. of incoming hits.
5) Refer ss-9: select another field "clientip.keyword" & select Donut as visualization type. Those many remote machines have access the web server(s). You can save this as your 2nd visualization & name it as "most frequent clients"
6) Heatmap is another "type" of visualization, just like bar & pie chart. By heatmap, you'll know from which regions you are getting 200 or 404 hits during a boxing match on Fox / NBC etc & act quickly if you see 404 error from that particular region.


Note:-
You can pull other server type (ex:- mysql) logs by changing the grok filter field.
Filter the mysql server logs in Kibana using host.os.family field.

These minimal visualizations will be enough for your org.
