** Grok pattern for filtering apache web logs
%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}

ex:- 
    grok
    {
        match => { "message" => "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}"}
    }

match:-
Value type is hash
Default value is {}
A hash that defines the mapping of where to look, and with which patterns.

For example, the following will match an existing value in the message field for the given pattern, and if a match is found,,
will add the field duration to the event with the captured value:

    filter {
      grok {
        match => {
          "message" => "Duration: %{NUMBER:duration}"
        }
      }
    }
